# U1LA1.1: Building with HTML

### Teacher Notes & Overview

In this lesson, students will begin by working with basic HTML tags and reading documentation. The focus will not be on making something pretty, but on making pages that allow them to practice writing HTML tags and using their resources in a meaningful way.

If you did not complete a Unit 0, please allow extra time in the lesson to make sure students are set up on repl.it. Students who completed the pre-requisite ICM course likely have accounts but may need to ensure they can still get logged in. If you have a vision for student organization, you may also want to take time to help them set up folders in the 'My Repls' section.

### Objectives

Students will be able to:

* Utilize documentation to guide their project creation
* Place header and paragraph elements on a page&#x20;
* Create anchor links with `href` attributes Use IMG tags (from a local source, and from a source on the web)&#x20;
* Create ordered and unordered lists&#x20;
* Explain the difference between elements that have opening and closing tags (most of them) and elements that do not (images, horizontal rules, css links, etc.)

### Suggested Duration

2 periods (\~90 minutes)

### NYS Computing Standards

* **9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.
* **9-12.DL.2** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.
* **9-12.DL.5** Transfer knowledge of technology in order to use new and emerging technologies on multiple platforms.

### Vocabulary

* **HTML:** 'HyperText Markup Language,' the skeleton of websites that provides structure to text on a page.
* **Documentation:** code explained as plainly as possible, often with examples, to help you figure out how and when to use different code language or library elements.
* **Tag:** In HTML, tags define HTML elements and are determined by triangle brackets, like this: `<h1> Everything here is in the h1 tag </h1>`. Many tags have an opening and closing, denoted by a / before the tag name. Today, students will see `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<a>`, and more.
* **Self-closing tags:** Self closing tags do not have the \</tag name> close at the end. They often still have the / that comes at the end of the opening and only tag. Image tags are a great example, and end up looking like this: `<img src="myphoto.jpg"/>`

| When using repl.it, please determine if you would like students to clone directly from GitHub, or if you will be setting up assignments via Teams for Education. | _No special materials are required, but as it's the first day, make sure computers are charged and ready to go!_ |

### Suggestions for UDL

|                             Multiple Means of Representation                            |                                       Multiple Means of Engagement                                       |                                    Multiple Means of Expression                                    |

| _How are you going to present your content so that it meets the needs of ALL students?_ | _How are you going to provide multiple pathways for students to actually learn the material presented?_  | _How will students demonstrate what they have learned?  How will you assess progress and mastery?_ |

### Suggestions for Differentiation

### Resources

* ****[**Repl.it** ](https://replit.com/\~)- online IDE
* ****[**W3 Schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) **** - readable documentation
* **(OPTIONAL)** [**MDN**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) **-** a robust but sometimes less student-friendly documentation
* ****[**What is HTML, CSS, JavaScript?** ](https://youtu.be/gT0Lh1eYk78)(Youtube Video)
* **Practice Original**

### Assessments

**Formative:**

**Summative:**

### Do Now/Warm Up (\~5 min)

Will probably be something around logging into repl.it and either joining the class assignment or starting a new repl, depending on teacher choice. (In lesson 2, will involve forking an assignment and looking at some code.)

### Mini Lesson: How are webpages built? && Your First HTML (\~x - y min)
