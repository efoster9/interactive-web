# My Fan Page - Part 1

### Teacher Notes

_Students pick up HTML element tags and nesting best through practice. This mini-lab is designed to have them explore these ideas through a lense they feel most comfortable with._

_Be careful sharing [documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/) for this lesson. The list of HTML Elements are cumbersome and can be overwhelming for students. Instead, consider showing students the few elements you'd like them to practice using, and have them look up examples if need be._

### Prompt

Who's your favorite TV character, celebrity, historical figure/role model? Imagine you were hired to make a fan page website for them. What would you include: a brief bio, a bunch of photos, links to other sites where you can see more of them?

**Directions**: Your task is to build a website/ fan page with enough content to convince anyone that this person is worth knowing about. Include the following:

- The person's name
- About me section that talks about what they're known for
- Movie appearances, popular events, achievements, or fictional locations that they've made an appearance to.
- At least 4 images of them
- Other websites you can go to to find their work/ impact on the world.

**Requirements**:

Include the following html elements in your code...

1. An html skeleton (html, head, body)
2. At least two header elements(h1, h3, etc)
3. At least one paragraph element
4. At least one image element
5. At least one anchor element linking to another page
6. All the elements above are nested inside the body
7. Encapsulate sections in a `div`
8. Stretch: Display something (like the other websites) as a list.

Finished with your HTML and want to browse through more specific colors? Check out this [Color Picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1002US1002&oq=color+picker&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i131i433i512l2j0i433i512j0i131i433i512j69i60j69i61j69i60.1520j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) or search "Color Picker" on Google and select an exact color.

### Extensions

**Directions**:

- Turn your list of appearances into a table with a title, date, a picture, and a description.
- You may have noticed that some your page is styled with colors. Add IDs and class names where appropriate and see if you can fiddle with the colors on your page. Use the example lab to help you.

**Reflection Questions:**

- What are some things you would do to make this website prettier if you could and had more time? You may want to look online for some inspiration.
