# My Fan Page - Part 2

### Teacher Notes

_If students missed the first lab or don't feel they have all the essential components to effectively get some experience with CSS, have them use the starter code. Otherwise, encourage students to build off of what they already have._

_There's a lot of fun things to add to your website with CSS. Give students the documentation and the liberty to explore as many additional things beyond the requirements found here. However, encourage them to start with these foundational styling techniques before doing so._

### Prompt

We've seen the limitations HTML has when trying to build a beautiful website. It's time to take your Fan Pages to the next level. By adding spacing, colors, and other styling via CSS, we can really make these websites even more special.

**Directions**: Your task is to add styling to the website you've created in the previous lab. Use IDs for unique elements and class names for repeated styling to style different portions of your website. Don't forget to link the css file in the head of your HTML code. Consider including things such as, but not limited to, margin around the whole page, padding within certain `div` sections, and a change in background color.

**Requirements**:

Add styles to each of the following...

1. At least 2 element tags (h1, img, a, p, etc.)
2. At least 3 IDs (they should have unique styles).
3. At least 2 classes that are used at least twice each
4. At least 1 change in text color, background color, margin, padding, and border.

### Extra Help?

I can't get my images to center! Always look up your questions on w3schools.com before asking your teacher, but this one in particular is tricky. Check out [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp) to see an example on how to do it.

Where can I find some cool, unique colors? Check out [Google's Color Picker](https://hexcolorspicker.com/google-color-picker/). Simply search "Color Picker" on Google, select an exact color, and copy and paste the hex number. Check out [this CSS example](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_text_background) in w3schools on how to apply it to your CSS code.

### Extensions

**Directions**:

- Checkout [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_google.asp) and see if you can implement some uniquely customized fonts onto your fan page.
- Do a search for "shadow in CSS" and see if you can find a w3schools page that shows you how to implement shadow onto your fan page. You can add it to things like text or to an entire div.
- Tricky! Have you ever hovered over something with your mouse on a website and watched it change in someway? Do a search for "hover in CSS" and see if you can apply some dynamic changes to your webpage. HINT: start with something really obvious to check that it works before scaling it back.

**Reflection Questions:**

- Do a search for some examples of some good looking and not so good looking websites. What's the difference? Name at least 5 observable characteristics of a bad looking website, and name what CSS you would try to use to make the website look better.
- You may have noticed that there are a couple of different ways to use a color. You can use RGB, RGBA, Hexadecimal, and just a color name like 'red'. When might it make more sense to use one over another? Which is your favorite to use, and why?
