# My Fan Page - Part 1

### Teacher Notes / Teacher Feedback

*Students pick up HTML element tags and nesting best through practice. This mini-lab is designed to have them explore these ideas through a lense they feel most comfortable with.*

*Be careful sharing [documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/) for this lesson. The list of HTML Elements are cumbersome and can be overwhelming for students. Instead, consider showing students the few elements you'd like them to practice using, and have them look up examples if need be.*
