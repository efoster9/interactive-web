# U1LA1.2: Structuring Pages with Divs, Classes, IDs

### Teacher Notes && Overview

In this lesson, students will begin understanding how they can use divs along with classes and IDs to create a more structured page layout.

To increase understanding, the starter code includes a CSS file that has predefined class and ID definitions. This allows students to see divs for what they are, as opposed to just blank empty spaces, without needing to learn all the CSS involved or complex grid systems right away. Please make sure students understand that divs are just empty boxes, but we have done a bit of styling on that box to make it more visible to them as they work. Students will not be able to get the same style in any old HTML file as it involves definitions we've put in the CSS, and they will be learning more about this in the coming lessons.

(_The styling we have chosen is also a little ugly and over the top, and that's okay - it's to help you tell things apart!_)

### Objectives

**Students will be able to:**

* Create divs with class and ID tags
* Nest div elements inside of other div elements
*

### Suggested Duration

1-2 Periods (\~45 - 90 min)

### NYS Standards

* **9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.
* **9-12.DL.2** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.
* **9-12.DL.5** Transfer knowledge of technology in order to use new and emerging technologies on multiple platforms.

### Vocabulary

* **div:** an HTML element that defines a region or section of an HTML document. We can think of it as an empty box. A div contains content and also has padding (space between content and border) borders (outside edges of the div), and margins (space between the div and every other page element).
* **Class:** a name assigned to an HTML element to group it with other related elements. Classes are used in styling. As a best practice, if you create a class, it is because you anticipate multiple elements sharing the class.
* **ID:** a name assigned to an HTML element to differentiate it with others of the same type of element. IDs are used in styling. As a best practice, if you create an ID, it is because an element is unique and will not share style with other elements.
