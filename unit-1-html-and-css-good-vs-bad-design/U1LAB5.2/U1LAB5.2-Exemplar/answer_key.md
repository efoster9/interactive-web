# Answer Key Outline U1LAB5.2

## Level 1: Broken accessibility issues
- All `divs` should be changed to semantic element tags.
- All `alt` text for images should be descriptive.
- Text included in links should be more descriptive than "click me".

## Level 2: Easy forms practice
- 1st question is the exemplar. Nothing to check.
- 2nd and 3rd question (pizza toppings & Getaway house) should be put it in a `<fieldset>`, and should use a `<legend>`.
- All `<label>` elements should have a `for=""` attribute with the value corresponding to the input field's `id` value.
- The two text inputs should include the `autocomplete` attribute. 
- The `<input type="submit"/>` button should have a `name` and `value` attribute. 

## Extension: More difficult forms practice
- The table should use the following element tags instead of `div`: `<table>`, `<caption>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`.
- The _Name_ input field should include an `autocomplete` attribute.
- The _Birthday_ input field should include a `required` attribute.
- The _Email_ input field should include an `autocomplete` and `required` attribute.
- The dropdown menu _"Submit Option"_ should have its label connected with a `for` attribute, and the submit image should have `alt` text.
