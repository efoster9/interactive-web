          Hippos are vicious animals from Africa that that live on land but
          spend most of their time in the water. The area they live in consists
          of many other animals including the too vicious lions. What happens
          when they battle head to head?

      <div class="h2">Their Size and Bite</div>
      <div class="side-card">
        <div class="p">
          Typically size and strength will determine who wins in the wild.
          Hippos are 10 times heavier than a lion, and hippos have a bite that
          is twice as strong. They have 36 sharp and powerful teeth while lions
          only have their 2, 4-inch long fangs.

          Lions can catch hippos moving at speeds up to 50mph where as hippos
          can only trot at speeds up to 30mph. Lion's have better senses and can
          see at night, where as hippos merely have an advantage seeing under
          murky waters. Hippos have a thick skin which helps defend them, and
          lions use their speed, size and power in numbers to scare away other
          animals. Hippos will win in the power department, but lions have more
          finesse.

      <div class="h2">Conclusion</div>
      <div class="side-card">
        <div class="p">
          Hippos have had to fight lions in the wild before. Lions are
          carnivores, and they're good at fighting in packs using ambush
          tactics. In a group, lions would win. Hippos typically attack from and
          live in the waters a place that would give them a clear advantage
          versus a lion. Though they are almost purely herbivores, a single
          hippo will win in a fight against a single lion.
