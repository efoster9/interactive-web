# U1LA2.1: Styling your page with CSS

### Teacher Notes && Overview

In this lesson, students will begin working with CSS to style their pages. They will begin by working on a pre-made page of starter code and will have free time to experiment with their CSS. The goal of this code is to make an 'ugly' webpage - this allows students the freedom to play with any CSS properties that strike them as interesting without attempting to adhere to good design principles or trying to make something 'pretty.'

### Objectives

* Style different portions of their page by selecting HTML tags in CSS
* Style different portions of their page by selecting classes/IDs in their CSS
* Use HEX code colors within their CSS
* Adjust margins/padding/borders
* Center and enlarge images in CSS
* Change fonts on their webpage
