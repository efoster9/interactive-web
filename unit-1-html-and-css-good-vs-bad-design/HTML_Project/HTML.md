### Prompt

It's vacation time, and people need your website to help them get started. Will you show the next location they're going to, and entice them with things to do and place to see like this [Germany travel site](https://www.germany.travel/en/home.html) or this [Dominican Republic one](https://www.godominicanrepublic.com/)? Will you create a site for the transit in that city including bus routes and trains like [the NYC MTA site](https://new.mta.info/agency/new-york-city-transit)? Or, will your page be a center for available hotels in the area allowing people to book right on the site like [MGM Resorts](https://www.mgmresorts.com/en.html) or a more generic [Hotels.Com](https://www.hotels.com/)? 

**Directions**: Choose a website idea that will help people with their travels, and create a single webpage that is both accessible and responsive. We recommend creating a travel page like the Germany or Dominican Republic site above, but you can alternatively choose to do a transit help page or a Hotel help page for any city.

Once you decide and choose a city, do some research on what similar sites already exist, and determine which parts of the website you want to copy and which parts you want to make better. This is your opportunity to put everything you've learned so far together in one site.

**Requirements**:

There are a couple of things that should be included in your website:

1. A **Navbar**, a **Footer**, and at least one section of **Cards**.
2. A section with a **Form** containing things like text-boxes, checkboxes, dropdown menus, etc. _(For example: a "subscribe now" form, find hotels by date and location, or a quick survey for quality assurance)_
3. Other than the above 4 sections, at least 3 more sections - maybe a second navbar, a hero, a gallery section, etc.
3. The use of **Grid** -- either with CSS or with Bulma
4. It should be **100% Accessible**.
5. It should look good on Mobile and on Desktop; **100% Responsive**.
