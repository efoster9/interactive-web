description: How can I create well designed and accessible webpages with HTML and CSS?

# ðŸ”® Unit 1 Overview

### Overview

In this first unit, students begin building webpages using HTML and CSS. They will learn how to organize their pages using CSS Grid and Flexbox, as well as CSS Frameworks such as Bulma. Students will also focus on Breakpoints to ensure their pages work on a variety of devies, as well as accessibility so the pages are usable by everyone who may want to engage with them.

To finish the unit, students will create a final project page utilizing all of the skills they have learned before continuing on to learn about making websites interactive in unit 2.

### Nota Bene

This unit, as much of the curriculum, is structured in both _lessons_ and _labs._ Lessons are primarily teacher-led activities - often via code alongs - supplemented with some space for students to practice. Labs are _exclusively_ opportunities for students to practice and express themselves.

Suggested durations are given for each, but assume that most will take more than one day; a good pacing goal is to get through 1-2 lessons and 1-2 labs per week, which will vary week to week based on the depth of content being covered.

### NYS Standards

**NB:** _HTML and CSS are considered 'mark-up' languaes, not programming languages. As such, many Computational Thinking skills will be better addressed in future units._

* **9-12.DL.1** Type proficiently on a keyboard.
* **9-12.DL.2** Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.
* **9-12.DL.5** Transfer knowledge of technology in order to use new and emerging technologies on multiple platforms.
* **9-12.IC.1** Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.
* **9-12.IC.5** Describe ways that complex computer systems can be designed for inclusivity and to mitigate unintended consequences.
* **9-12.IC.6** Create accessible computational artifacts that meet standard compliance requirements or otherwise meet the needs of users with disabilities.

### Suggested Duration

Approx. 5-6 weeks for core content and 1-2 weeks for the Final Project.

### Prerequisite Skills

This first unit assumes little to no prior knowledge of HTML/CSS, but it does dive immediately into coding.&#x20;

As this is an intermediate course, students are recommended to have had some computer science exposure prior to starting; being able to interact with an IDE/editor and code documentation will make life easier and allow students to move through content more quickly.
